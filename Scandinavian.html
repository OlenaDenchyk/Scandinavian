		<h2>A Nordic-Inspired Interior Design Guide</h2>
		<p>Scandinavian interior design—whether you’ve seen it in an Ikea catalog, minimalist blogs, or your best friend’s living room, you probably already know how this popular home design style feels. Scandinavian interior design—whether you’ve seen it in an Ikea catalog, minimalist blogs, or your best friend’s living room, you probably already know how this popular home design style feels. In this guide, we’ll teach you key Scandinavian design principles to help you understand the meaning behind the look, and offer useful Scandinavian design tips so that you, too, can enjoy the benefits of this beautiful, practical, and calming interior design style. No Scandinavian ancestry required.</p>
		<h3>1. MINIMIZE</h3>
		<p>Scandinavian design emphasizes bright, light, and open spaces, with enough room to move and breathe within them. Visual elements like clean lines and white space evoke a sense of calm and capacity. One thing a Scandinavian room is not? Cluttered.<br>Naturally, the first step for most is decluttering. But rather than going for a stark and ultra-minimalist look, we suggest you aim for lagom, a Swedish term that translates to “in between” or “just right.” We want not too much, and not too little. A similar concept is Japanese organizer Marie Kondo’s “just-right click point.” It’s personal, and you’ll know it when you get there.<br>If you do need some concrete tips for lagom, use pattern and color sparingly (in rugs and accents, for example), and try balancing any too much-ness with opposite qualities in the room. Then, to hone in on your individual definition of lagom, add or remove items until you feel like you’ve arrived. And don’t forget: shop and add pieces to your rooms with mindfulness. Scandinavian décor on a budget is easier than you think! To learn more about lagom beyond its application to interiors, read this book by design-lover and England-to-Sweden transplant Niki Brantmark.

		<h3>2. CHOOSE QUALITY</h3>
		<p>In keeping with the Scandinavian tradition of craftsmanship, invest in high quality, multi-purpose or practical pieces, if you don’t already have them. Scandinavian furniture, light fixtures, and other functional items should have a modern and striking look, while remaining simple and not overly ornate.<br>Take note: this doesn’t mean sacrificing style. In fact, when ordinary items are made well (and from high quality materials), they can become decorative elements in their own right. Look for the design in the ordinary and storage-as-décor pieces like garment and shoe racks, shelves and organizers, and other storage-included items—all of which can function as helpers in your home and stunning design elements.</p>

		<h3>3. BRING NATURE INSIDE</h3>
		<p>Scandinavians have a unique and hard-earned appreciation for nature because, historically, natural resources in Scandinavian countries were scarce. People had to learn to work with nature, to understand and respect it, in order to get the most out of what nature offered. This appreciation for nature comes through in the way Scandinavians spend time outdoors, and in the way they design and decorate their homes.<br>You can honor nature as a Scandinavian design principle by incorporating natural elements, such as light and bright wood, nature-inspired sculptural pieces, house plants, and natural textiles and upholstery, such as wool, mohair, sheepskin, linen, jute, burlap, and more. Use plants and natural objects in vignettes. Let in light and views from outside. And whenever you can, use eco-friendly and sustainable materials in your home.</p>

		<h3>4. THINK NEUTRAL</h3>
		<p>When considering color, imitate the palette of nature—think earth, stone, and wood, with pops of brighter color. A neutral color scheme is simple yet sophisticated, and choosing lighter versions of wall color gives lightness, as does light wood. This backdrop makes it possible for furniture pieces to function as accents, providing interest and contrast. With larger blocks of accent color—and color is allowed—go for grayish blues, green plants, warm tan, neutral (unsaturated) versions of color, monochromatic color stories, and graphic and botanical prints. With smaller accents, bright and bold colors are welcome infusions of joy. For a sense of the livelier accent hues, see the work of famous Finnish design house Marimekko.

		<h3>5. USE CONTRAST</h3>
		<p>As with most interior design styles, Scandinavian room design relies on the design principle of contrast. And while many people typically think of colors at the opposite ends of the color wheel when they hear the word contrast, in this case, contrast can apply to a wide range of design elements (think: shape, size, texture, mood). Instead of contrasting colors, contrast light and dark neutrals, old pieces and new pieces, abstract and natural, straight and wavy, neutral and flashes of color, hard and soft, utility and coziness. To heighten the look, find ways to contrast your foundational pieces, such as walls, furniture, light fixtures, and wall art.</p>
